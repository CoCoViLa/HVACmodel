<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p> <em>Process </em> is the component that controls the simulation process.
 The most important parameter here is  <em>time</em>, that is given in minutes and shows how long the simulation is running.
  For example, 1440 is one day, 2880 is two days.</p>

<p>NB! This class must be marked as  <em>Super</em>.</p>

<h2 id="timer">Clock</h2>
<p> <em>Timer</em>  is the component that produces time signal at each time interval. 
In our simulation, time interval is chosen to be one minute. </p>
<p>This component must be connected to each component, there time is required, for example to <em>Scheduler</em>.</p>
