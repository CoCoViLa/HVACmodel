<h1>Simulation results</h1>
<p>To see the simulation process we need to construct scheme, where all required components are placed and connected. There are two schemes in the package, the simple one - <em>houseModel3.syn</em>  is without <em>Cost</em> component and models only temperature. The <em>cost.syn</em>  does the same and outputs second graph with cost of the electricity. </p>

<p>As you can see, there are all required components, such as: outdoor conditions, house model, heater/cooler model, thermostat controller, timer and visualization tools. All parameters assigned by default values.</p>

<p> There three series: required temperature, outdoor temperature and current temperature in the room. As you can see, the air conditioner was able to hold required temperature with such outdoor condition. The cost of one day of heating/cooling under such conditions is $~23$ euros.</p>
