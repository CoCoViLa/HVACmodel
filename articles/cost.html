<p>One of it's properties  is price of the electricity (kW-h). We suppose that all electric energy is transformed to heat energy. Also, usually we have price for (kW-h), but in our model we have (J), so we transform between them using  1 kW-h=3.6e6J.</p>

<p>The output value of <em>Cost</em> component is accumulated cost of the house heating/cooling. The input is the heat flow from heater/cooler.</p>
