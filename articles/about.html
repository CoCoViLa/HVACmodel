<h1>General Description</h1>
<p>Nowadays, the big amount of energy is spent in buildings, mainly in such  sub- <wbr>systems as heating, ventilation and cooling. Reducing energy consumption in this field is a trend, because of economic and environmental issues.</p>

<p>In this work we try to model the energy consumption for heating/cooling air in simple house with windows, which is modeled by one volume. Energy dissipation depends on the dimensions of house, the materials from
which the house is built and outside temperature. But energy consumption can be reduced by efficient control of heating <wbr> or cooling.</p>

<p>We propose a CoCoViLa package for modeling and simulation of heating and cooling processes of house with air heating. The system consists of several components, such as: house, heater/cooler, controller, thermostat, etc. The simulation results can help to choose parameters for comfort temperature, properties of the heater/cooler and modify the control algorithms. Initially, this package was inspired by Simulink demo "Thermal model of the
house" .</p>
