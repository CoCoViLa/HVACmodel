<h1>Component: Graph</h1><ul><li><a href="#multiseriesGraph">Multiseries graph</a></li><li><a href="#signalGraph">Signal graph</a></li></ul><h2 id="multiseriesGraph">Multiseries graph</h2><p><em>MultiSeriesGraph</em>  is the component for drawing multi-series graphs. In our case, we use it for drawing temperature and cost graphs. It can process one or more series.  Mainly, there are two important parameters:  <em>seriesNames</em> and  <em>lineThickness</em>, which help to adjust visual properties of the graph.</p><p>Also, the  x  axis in our case is time, although one unit in the series is considered to be minute, the numbers on axis are given by hours.</p><p>NB! This component must be marked as  <em>Static </em>.</p><h2 id="signalGraph">Signal graph</h2>
